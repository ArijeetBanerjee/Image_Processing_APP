# Image_Processing_APP
Developed a tool that allows users to perform various image processing operations  like resizing, cropping, and filtering.

 🚀Introducing a powerful "Image Processing Tool" designed to make image manipulation a breeze! Here are some of its fantastic features: 

 🌟 Load Image: Users can effortlessly load their images into the application.

 🌟 Display Image: Seamlessly view the loaded image within the application, making it easier to see the changes you're making.

 🌟 Image Filters: I've implemented a variety of basic image filters, including grayscale, blur, and sharpen, so you can enhance your images with just a few clicks.

 🌟 Color Adjustment: Adjust image colors, brightness, and contrast to achieve the perfect look for your images.

 🌟 Crop and Resize: Crop and resize your images with precision and ease. Get the exact dimensions you need!

 🌟 Image Saving: Once you're satisfied with the edits, save your beautifully processed image effortlessly.

🌈 I've taken it a step further by designing a user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for everyone. 🎨
This project challenged me to combine my skills in C++, software development, and user interface design.
